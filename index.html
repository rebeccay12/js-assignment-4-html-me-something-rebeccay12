      <p>In May of 2023, my family went on a trip to Ireland. This trip was planned for years and was meant to see the main sites of the country while also learning about family heritage and meeting relatives. </p>

         <h2>Galway County</h2>

         <p>The trip started in Galway, Ireland. In County Galway, we stayed in the city of Galway. This county is where my great grandfather is from, so we took a day excursion to Clonbur and were able to meet my grandmother's cousins and see where my great grandfather grew up. Within the city of Galway, we ate traditional Irish food and visited pubs while listening to live music, something that would become common on our trip.</p>

      <p>Next, we transitioned to Killarney to explore the southwestern portion of the country. On our way, we stopped at the Cliffs of Moher and saw the beautiful view of the ocean. In Killarney, we were able to explore the coast and travel to the city of Dingle. We also went to the beginning of the Ring of Kerry. </p>

      <p>After leaving Killarney, we headed to Cork. On the way, we stopped at the Blarney Castle and kissed the Blarney Stone. The Blarney Stone is said to give the gift of eloquence. We explored the city of Cork and went to the English Market. We also went to the Jameson Distillery in Midleton and learned about Irish whiskey production while sampling different types of whiskey. </p>
